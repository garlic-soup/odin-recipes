   <h3>Description</h4>
   <p>This old-fashioned breaded chicken cutlets recipe is a labor of love, but it is well worth the effort. The cutlets are great served with mashed potatoes and a veggie, and they are also terrific on focaccia bread with mayo, lettuce, tomato, and onion. However you serve them, they will not disappoint!</p>
